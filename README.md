## Overview
This repository accompanies the preprint The ϕ Protocol: A Geometric Coherence Law Unifying Early Cosmology and the Hierarchy Problem by Marta Reinhardt (Independent Researcher), published on Zenodo on November 23, 2025.
The standard ΛCDM cosmological model faces a Crisis of Coherence due to observations of mature galaxies at redshifts z > 10 by JWST. These structures require more time to form than allowed by the standard expansion history.
We introduce the ϕ Protocol: a fundamental Geometric Coherence Law replacing the static cosmological constant with a dynamic energy-density term ρ_α(z) arising from geometric leakage in a Randall–Sundrum II (RS-II) brane-bulk framework. The dynamic term, expressed through a hyperbolic secant profile, provides a transient early-universe acceleration consistent with JWST, BAO, and CMB data, achieving statistical coherence with χ²/dof ≈ 1.03.
We prove that this phenomenological term is the 4D projection of the RS-II metric, establishing a unified resolution to the early structure problem, the H₀ tension, and the particle physics Hierarchy Problem.
The ϕ Protocol makes two falsifiable predictions:
The first Kaluza–Klein graviton at 1.42 ± 0.06 TeV, testable at the HL-LHC.
A deviation from Newtonian gravity of ∆g/g ≈ 8.3 × 10⁻⁹ at 72 µm.
Key Contributions
Dynamic Term: Ω_α(z) = α sech²[β ln(1 + z) - β ln(1 + γ)], with fitted parameters α = 0.412 ± 0.003, γ = 11.92 ± 0.08, β ≈ 1 (rescaled for visualization; physical β = k/H₀ ~ 10⁵⁴).

Unified Framework: Derives from RS-II Weyl curvature projection, linking cosmology to particle physics.
Empirical Fit: Improves χ²/dof from >>1 (ΛCDM) to 1.03 ± 0.04 using JWST + BAO + CMB data.
